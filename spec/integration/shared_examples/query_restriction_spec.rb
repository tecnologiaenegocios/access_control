  # These examples require the definition of three levels of STI model
  # (ActiveRecord) classes for the `sti_records' table, without special
  # permissions (permissions will be associated when needed in this
  # file):
  #
  #   `record_class' ->
  #     `specialized_record_class' ->
  #       `super_specialized_record_class'
  #
  # It is implicitly assumed that a user (`user') is currently logged in and
  # has some role (`role') associated (globally or in a parent record, it
  # doesn't matter, but you should consider testing both kinds).
  #
  # Finally, the records themselves must be early created using `let!', within
  # these names: `record', `specialized_record' and `super_specialized_record'.
